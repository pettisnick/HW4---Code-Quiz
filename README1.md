# HW4---Code-Quiz

I have created a 10 question multiple choice Javascript Coding Quiz. 
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts at 300 seconds (5 minutes) and counts its way down to 0
After clicking on start, I am presented with a question that has 3 different options to choose from
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question with 3 other options to choose from
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN 15 seconds is subtracted from the total time of the clock
When I answer a question correctly
Then I am rewarded 10 points to my total score
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
